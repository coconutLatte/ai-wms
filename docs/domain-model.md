## Entity Details

### Warehouse
The top-level organizational unit. Represents a physical building.
- **Status**: active, inactive, archived
- A Warehouse contains multiple Zones

### Zone
A logical area within a warehouse with a specific function.
- **Types**: receiving, storage, picking, shipping, returns, staging
- **Status**: active, inactive, full
- A Zone contains multiple Locations

### Location
A specific storage position (shelf, bin, pallet position, conveyor slot, AGV dock).
- **Types**: pallet, shelf, floor, conveyor, agv
- **Status**: empty, occupied, reserved, blocked
- **Status machine** (enforced via `CanTransitionTo`):
  ```
  empty ──→ occupied
  empty ──→ reserved
  empty ──→ blocked
  occupied ──→ empty
  occupied ──→ blocked
  reserved ──→ occupied
  reserved ──→ empty
  reserved ──→ blocked
  blocked ──→ empty
  ```
  - `IsTerminal()` returns true only for `blocked` (location is out of service)
  - Same-status transitions are rejected (no-op guard)
- Has optional Capacity (max weight, volume, quantity)
- Identified by a barcode label

### SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
A unique product variant. The master data for everything stored in the warehouse.
- Has physical attributes (weight, dimensions)
- Has UOM (base unit, pack unit, conversion ratio)
- Has flexible Attributes (JSONB in DB)
- **Status**: active, inactive, discontinued

### Inventory
The physical presence of a SKU at a Location. This is the **most critical** entity.
- `qty` = on-hand quantity
- `reserved_qty` = allocated to orders but not yet picked
- `available_qty` = qty - reserved_qty (computed, not stored)
- Batch/lot tracked per inventory record
- **Status**: available, quarantine, damaged, expired
- FEFO/FIFO based on production_date and expiry_date

### InventoryTransaction
Immutable audit record of every inventory change.
- **Types**: receipt, putaway, pick, ship, transfer, adjustment, return
- Records `delta_qty` (change) and `resulting_qty` (after)
- Links to reference document (order, task, etc.)

### Order
A business document requesting inventory movement.
- **Types**: inbound (receiving), outbound (shipping), transfer, return
- **Status flow**: draft → confirmed → processing → partial → completed (or cancelled)
- Has Priority: low, normal, high, urgent
- Links to external systems via external_ref

### OrderLine
A single line item in an order. Tracks ordered vs fulfilled quantities.
- **Status**: pending → allocated → partial → fulfilled (or cancelled)

### ASN (Advanced Shipping Notice)
Pre-notification of an inbound delivery. Links to an inbound Order.
- **Status**: pending → arrived → receiving → partial → received

### Task
A single warehouse operation assigned to a worker.
- **Types**: putaway, pick, replenish, transfer, cycle_count, load, unload
- **Status flow**: pending → assigned → in_progress → completed
- Has from_location and to_location for movement tasks
- Has expected_qty vs actual_qty for variance tracking

### Wave
A group of orders batched for efficient picking.
- **Types**: single_order, batch, zone, carrier
- Contains a set of Order IDs and generated Task IDs

### User
A system user (admin or warehouse operator).
- Linked to Roles for permissions
- **Status**: active, inactive, locked

### Role
A named collection of Permissions.
- Standard roles: admin, operator, picker

### Permission
Resource + Actions pair. Example: `{resource: "warehouse", actions: ["read","create"]}`
- Resource "*" = all resources
- Action "*" = all actions

## State Machines

### Order Lifecycle
```
draft → confirmed → processing → completed
  │         │            │
  └─────────┴────────────┴──→ cancelled
                    │
                    └──→ partial (some lines still pending)
```

### Task Lifecycle
```
pending → assigned → in_progress → completed
  │          │           │
  └──────────┴───────────┴──→ cancelled
                     │
                     └──→ exception (needs human)
                              │
                              └──→ in_progress (resolved)
```

### Inventory Status
```
available ←→ quarantine (quality hold)
available → damaged (inspection failure)
available → expired (past expiry_date)
```

## Business Rules

1. **Inventory cannot be negative.** Before any deduction, verify sufficient available qty.
2. **Location capacity.** If location has Capacity set, total inventory qty must not exceed it.
3. **Order → Task generation.** Confirming an order generates the necessary tasks (putaway for inbound, pick+ship for outbound).
4. **FIFO/FEFO allocation.** When allocating inventory for an outbound order, prefer:
   - FEFO: earliest expiry_date first (if set)
   - FIFO: earliest received_at first (if no expiry)
5. **Task completion updates inventory.** Completing a pick task decrements inventory; completing a putaway task increments inventory.
6. **All inventory changes are audited.** Every change creates an InventoryTransaction.
